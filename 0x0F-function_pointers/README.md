 block of memory is reserved by the compiler when we declare a variable. To store these memory addresses, C allows programmers to use the concept of pointers that can hold the address of any other data type. Pointers can be de-referenced using the asterisk * operator to get the value stored in an address. Like variables, instructions of a function are also stored in memory and have an address. A pointer pointing to the address of a function is called function pointer
